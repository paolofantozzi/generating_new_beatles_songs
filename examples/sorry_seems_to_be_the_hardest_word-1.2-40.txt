Sorry seems to be the hardest word
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
Oh, I've been alone now, oh

[Verse 2]
You don't know how long it will take
I know I'll have to wait just to hear your sigh

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone

[Verse 3]
You don't know how long it will take
I know I'll have to wait just to hear your sigh

[Verse 2]
Yesterday, I told her that while she'sbeen gone, I'll be going to see her again
Last night, I said that just like she said 
(Bop shuop)
You don't give me your number, do you think I'm crazy?

[Verse 1]
You call me on the phone, but I don't care
You tell me what to do, I only care
I never forget her, I never leave her now
You tell me, you don't care, you just don't care
What can I do?

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, I've been alone

[Verse 3]
You don't know how long it will take
I know I'll have to wait just to hear your sigh

[Verse 1]
I got a girl, a girl that's happy just to listen
I got a girl, a girl that's sad just to hear me say
That I'm just a girl, a girl who loves you so much
But a girl who says she loves you all the time
She just won't let me go, won't let you go
You tell me, you tell me somebody's doing me harm
I got a girl, a girl that doesn't need no diamond rings
I
