Love of my life
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain

[Bridge 1]
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my heart the words they said
They're no longer true

[Verse 2]
There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some have gone and some remain

[Bridge 2]
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my heart the words they said
They're no longer true

[Bridge 3]
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my heart the words they said
They're no longer true

Some have gone and some remain
