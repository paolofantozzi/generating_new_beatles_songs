<s_song>
I don't want to miss a thing
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
If you leave me
I'll never make it alone
And I won't ever give you my number
Again
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

[Verse 2]
You don't want my lovin' anymore
Don't want my love to stay
Don't want my love to show
You've really got a hold on me, baby

[Bridge]
I don't want to spoil the party
Oh, I don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here
If she turns up while I'm gone
I won't mind

[Verse 3]
I don't want to spoil the party
Oh, I don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here
If she turns up while I'm gone
I won't mind

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 1]
I don't want to spoil the party
Oh, I don't want to spoil the party
Oh, I don't want to spoil the party
Oh, I don't want to spoil the party
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

[Verse 2]
You don't want my lovin' anymore
Don't want my love to stay
Don't want my love to show
You've really got a hold on me, baby

[Bridge]
I don't want to spoil the party
Oh, I don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here
If she turns up while I'm gone
I won't mind

[Outro]
Ooooh oh la la la la
