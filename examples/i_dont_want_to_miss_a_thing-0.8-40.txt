I don't want to miss a thing
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
I don't want to miss a thing
It's only a whim, but a day or two goes by
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

[Verse 2]
I've got no time for trivialities
I've lost all hope
When every moment feels so...
It's only a whim, but a day or two goes by
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

[Chorus]
I don't want to miss a thing
It's only a whim, but a day or two goes by
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

[Verse 3]
You know I hate to see the sun
Sinking to the west
'Cause I know my whole life's
Gonna be one solid mess

[Chorus]
I don't want to miss a thing
It's only a whim, but a day or two goes by
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

[Verse 4]
You know I hate to see the sun
Falling in love again
Sinking to the west
'Cause I know my whole life's
Gonna be one solid mess

[Chorus]
I don't want to miss a thing
It's only a whim, but a day or two goes by
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

[Outro]
Ooooh oh
Yeah! Ow! Ow!

[Verse 5]
You know I hate to see the sun
Sinking to the west
'Cause I know my whole life's
Gonna be one solid mess

[Outro]
Aw! Ow! Ow!

[Chorus]
I don't want to miss a thing
It's only a whim, but a day or two goes by
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

[Verse 6]
You know I hate to see the sun
Sinking to the west
'Cause I know my whole life's
Gonna be one solid mess

[Outro]
Ooooh oh
Yeah! Ow!

[Verse 7]
You know I hate to see the sun
Thrusting it between my legs
Keeping my head down, I cry out loud
Hey! Yeah! Ow!

[Outro]
Aw! Ow!

[Verse 1]
I don't want to spoil the party
I don't want to spoil the party
It's only a whim, I think it's a dirty act

Money's tight, I think it's a dirty act
I don't want to spoil the party
Money's tight, I think it's a dirty act

[Verse 2]
I don't want to spoil the party
I don't want to spoil the party
It's only a whim, I think it's a dirty act

Money's tight, I think it's a dirty act
I don't want to spoil the party

Sinking to the west
'Cause I know my whole life's
Gonna be one solid mess

It's only a whim, but a day or two goes by
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

[Verse 4]
You know I hate to see the sun
Falling in love again
