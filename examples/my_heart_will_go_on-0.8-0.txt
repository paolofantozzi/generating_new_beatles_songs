<s_song>
My heart will go on
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Malcolm comes to me
Whispering words of wisdom
And Mother Malcolm lovinglyolds me

[Verse 2]
Though I know that my love is dead
And it is not dying
I go looking for a way to live
That has not gone awry
And I find it only
Dreams of my life

[Bridge]
And in my dreams I hope that my love will return
And in her eyes I see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 3]
But in my dreams I see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Outro]
Oh, Darling, it's you (That's what I want)
Oh, Darling, it's you (That's what I want)
