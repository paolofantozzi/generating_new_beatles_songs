<s_song>
Leave me alone
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And lonely people shout at me
I won't leave them behind
You know I believe and how

[Verse 2]
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And lonely people cry
I won't leave them behind
You know I believe and how
<e_song>

And lonely people cry
I won't leave them behind
You know I believe and how
