Sorry seems to be the hardest word
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
Last night, I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl

[Chorus]
It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
(
Sha la la la la la
)
It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
(
Sha la la la la
)

[Verse 2]
You don't realize how much I love you
You know I care and how
 (
How they kiss me)

[Chorus]
It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
(
Sha la la la la
)
It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
(
Sha la la la
)

[Bridge]
But the way you deceive me, girl
I don't care if you lose your mind
(
Sha la la la la la
)
You make me cry, girl
I don't care if you lose your mind
(
Sha la la la la la
)

[Verse 3]
You wear your face in a show, girl
Do you understand, girl
I don't care if you lose your mind
(
Sha la la la la
)
You make me cry, girl
I don't care if you lose your mind
(
Sha la la la la
)

[Outro]
You don't realize how much I love you
You know I care and how
(
How they kiss me)
