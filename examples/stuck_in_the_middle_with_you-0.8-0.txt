<s_song>
Stuck in the middle with you
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
When I'm getting high I'm going to sit on my own
When you're passing on your way I'm going to jump in your arms
And you won't see me (you won't see me)

[Verse 2]
You know that I'm not the kind of guy you want to kiss
And that you won't see me (you won't see me)
<e_song>

<s_song>
Let It Be
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
When I'm getting high I'm going to sit on my own
When you're passing on your way I'm going to jump in your arms
And you won't see me (you won't see me)

[Verse 2]
You know that I'm not the kind of guy you want to kiss
And that you won't see me (you won't see me)
<s_song>
Let It Be
[Verse 1]
When I'm getting high I'm going to sit on my own
When you're passing on your way I'm going to jump in your arms
And you won't see me (you won't see me)

[Verse 2]
You know that I'm not the kind of guy you want to kiss
And that you won't see me (you won't see me)

[Bridge]
So let it be (let it be) let it be (let it be) let it be (let it be) let it be (let it be)
Whisper words of wisdom let it be
Let it be (let it be) let it be (let it be)

[Verse 3]
When I'm getting high I'm going to sit on my own
When you're passing on your way I'm going to jump in your arms
And you won't see me (you won't see me)

[Outro]
Let it be (let it be) let it be (let it be) let it be (let it be)
Let it be (let it be) let it be (let it be)
Let it be (let it be) let it be (let it be)
Whisper words of wisdom let it be
Let it be
Let it be (let it be) let it be (let it be) let it be (let it be)
Let it be (let it be) let it be (let it be)
Whisper words of wisdom let it be
Let it be
<e_song>

<s_song>
Let It Be (With You All Around)

When I'm getting high I'm sitting on my own
When you're passing on your way I'm going to jump in your arms
