<s_song>
Leave me alone
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
When I'm alone, all my troubles seem to vanish
When I'm with you, they're gone
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before

[Chorus]
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Don't let me go
You're not the same
No, no, no

[Verse 2]
I've had a drink or two, and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she isn't there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

[Chorus]
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Don't let me go
You're not the same
No, no, no

[Verse 3]
You don't give me presents, do you know who you are?
You don't give me presents, do you know who you are?
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

[Outro]

<s_song>
It Won’t Be Long
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
When I'm lonely, all my troubles seem to vanish
When I'm with you, they're gone
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before

[Verse 2]
Although I know what I want and deserve
There's no fun in what I do if she isn't there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her
<s_song>
It Won’t Be Long
[Verse 1]
When I'm lonely, all my troubles seem to vanish
When I'm with you, they're gone
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many, many times before

[Verse 2]
While I know what I want and deserve
There's no fun in what I do if she isn't there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her
<s_song>
It Won’t Be Long
[Verse 1]
When I'm lonely, all my troubles seem to vanish
When I'm with you, they're gone

Many, many, many, many times before

[Verse 3]
While I know what I want and deserve
There's no fun in what I do if she isn't there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
