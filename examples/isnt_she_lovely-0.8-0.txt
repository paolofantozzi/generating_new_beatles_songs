Isn't she lovely
[Lyrics]
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Isn't she pretty?
Isn't she the kind of girl you want so much?
You know she's the kind of girl you want so much

[Verse 2]
Isn't she sweet and lovely?
Isn't she the kind of girl you want so much?
You know she's the kind of girl you want so much, I just don't know

[Bridge]
I don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here, so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone, please let me know

[Verse 3]
Isn't she good-looking?
Isn't she pretty?
Isn't she the kind of girl you want so much?
You know she's the kind of girl you want so much, well, it's true
You know she's the kind of girl you want so much

[Verse 4]
Isn't she good-looking?
Isn't she pretty?
She's a girl who reads me books
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
