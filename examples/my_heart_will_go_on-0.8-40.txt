My heart will go on
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
Yes, I'll pretend that I'm kissing
And hope that my dreams will come true

[Verse 2]
I'll pretend that I'm in love with you
The first time that I love you
You've ever been mine
And 'til the day I do, I'm hoping you'll come true
Yes, I'll pretend that I'm in love with you
And hope that my dreams will come true

[Bridge]
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
I'm hoping that my dreams will come true

[Verse 3]
I'll pretend that I'm in love with you
The first time that I love you
You've ever been mine
And 'til the day I do, I'm hoping you'll come true
Yes, I'll pretend that I'm in love with you

[Bridge]
I'll pretend that I'm in love with you
The first time that I love you
You've ever been mine
And 'til the day I do, I'm hoping you'll come true
I'm hoping you'll come true
