<s_song>
Isn't she lovely
[Lyrics]
[Intro]
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Verse 1]
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe

[Verse 2]
Loving her is like being with another
Being with her is like being with another
Being with another is like being with another (Ooh)

[Verse 3]
Yes, she's my little girl
She's my little girl, she's my little girl, she's my little girl
She's my little girl, she's my little girl, girl oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Verse 2]
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe
It calls me on and on across the universe

[Verse 3]
From this moment on I know that she is mine
I know that she is mine
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

[Verse 4]
You're asking me will my love grow
I say she can't move on and on across the universe
You're asking me will my love grow
I say she can't move on and on across the universe
You're asking me will my love grow
I say she can't move on and on across the universe
<e_song>

<s_song>
What Can I Do?
[Refrain]
Can't you try to save my day
Can't you try to save my day

[Verse 1]
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Instrumental Outro]
<s_song>
Nothing can really do
Nothing can really do
Nothing can really do
Nothing really can do

[Verse 2]
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe
It calls me on and on across the universe
