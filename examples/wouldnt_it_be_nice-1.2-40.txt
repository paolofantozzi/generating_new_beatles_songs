Wouldn't it be nice
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love, from me to you

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
I've got everything that you want
Like a heart that's oh so true
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love, from me to you

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
That love of yours is something I can't hide
Though I hide my love for you
I'll be a singer for you

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
That love of yours, though I hide
My love for you, you know
Is something I'd hate for you
I'll be a singer for you

[Outro: Paul McCartney]
To you, to you, to you
