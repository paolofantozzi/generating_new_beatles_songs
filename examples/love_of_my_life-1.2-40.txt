Love of my life
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love, from me to you

[Verse 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
I got every intention of living
In every way that you see
In every way that you love
I'll send that along with love
With love, from me to you

[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
And it's true that I love you more than ever
It's true that I love you more

[Verse 3: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
I got every reason to be sad
Than to be alone
But let you know that I won't be alone
With love, from me wanting you all to

[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
And it's true that I love you more

[Verse 5: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
That knowing that love is real
It's true that I love you more

[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
And it's true that I love you more

There’s a Place
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
There—
There's a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong
There's a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And it really doesn't matter if I'm right
There's a place
There's a place
