Wouldn't it be nice
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands, now

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
She was a day tripper
A Sunday driver, yeah
It took me so long
To find out, and I found out

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands, now
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands, now

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
She was a working girl, so she worked
Monday till ten, then she went to church
Tuesday morning, she said, "I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide
I've got a feeling, a feeling I should've known was wrong"
So she said, "Please, please, don't let me down, don't let me down"
And so, she did

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands, now
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands, now

[Guitar Solo: Paul McCartney]
She was a working girl, so she worked
Monday till ten, then she went to church
Tuesday morning, she said, "I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide
I've got a feeling, a feeling I should've known was wrong"
So she said, "Please, don't let me down, don't let me down"

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
She was a working girl, so she worked
Monday till ten, now she went to church
Tuesday morning, she said, "I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide
I've got a feeling, a feeling I should've known was wrong"
So she said, "Please, don't let me down, don't let me down"

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands, now
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands, now
