Can't Help Falling in Love
[Lyrics]
[Intro]
Can't help falling in love
Can't help falling in love?
<s_song>
I Can't Help Falling in Love
[Pre-Chorus]
Can't help falling in love
Can't help falling in love?
<s_song>
Can't help falling in love
Can't help falling in love?
<s_song>
Let It Be
[Verse 1]
I think of you, but I can't seem to get you off my mind
That's what I said, 'cause you don't seem to like me

[Verse 2]
I think of you, but I can't quite get you off my mind
That's what I said, 'cause you don't seem to like me

[Bridge]
I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more, 'cause it's so hard loving you
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
And it's true, 'cause you're always so sweet to me

[Verse 3]
You're so sweet, Miss Lizzy
I love you, 'cause you dance so good
And the night you don't come my way
I'm gonna search you out and blot you out
But I can't find you

[Outro]
You gotta fall in love
Can't help it, Miss Lizzy
I can't believe it's happened to you

I Can't Help Falling in Love
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
I can't help myself, I can't seem to get you off my mind
You think I'm soft, Miss Lizzy
Then you say you love me too much and I like you
Oh, baby, it's you (You know it's you I like)
I can't take it anymore, I can't take it anymore
Can't we just fall in love again?

[Verse 2]
I can't believe it's happened to me, I can't believe it's happened to you
You've really got a hold on me, you know I need you
But you don't realize it's only you, you know it's only you
I can't take it anymore, I can't take it anymore
Can't we just fall in love again?

[Bridge]
I can't believe it's happened to me, I can't believe it's done
I can't believe it's happened to you
You're so sweet, Miss Lizzy
I love you, 'cause you dance so good
And the night you don't come my way
I'm gonna search you out and blot you out
But I can't find you
<s_song>
Can't Help Falling in Love
[Pre-Chorus]
Can't help falling in love
Can't help falling in love?
<s_song>
Can't help falling in love
Can't help falling in love?

Let It Be
[Verse 1]
I can't believe it's happened to me, I can't believe it's happened to you
You think I'm soft, Miss Lizzy
Then you say you love me too much and I like you
Oh, baby, it's you (You know it's you I like)
I can't take it anymore, I can't take it anymore
Can't we just fall in love again?
<s_song>
Can't Help Falling in Love
[Pre-Chorus]
Can't help falling in love
Can't help falling in love?

[Verse 2]
I can't believe it's happened to me, I can't believe it's happened to you
You think I'm soft, Miss Lizzy
Then you say you love me too much and I like you
Oh, baby, it's you (You know it's you I like)
I can't take it anymore, I can't take it anymore
Can't we just fall in love again?
