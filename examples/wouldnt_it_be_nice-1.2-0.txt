Wouldn't it be nice
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1: Paul McCartney, Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands, now

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
She was a day tripper
A Sunday driver, yeah
It took me so long
To find out, and I found out

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney, Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Just a love that lasts forever
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands, now

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
She was a day tripper
A Sunday driver, yeah
It took me so long
To find out, and I found out

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney, Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Won't you give me some-a lovin', baby
Please, please, please
Please, please
Please, dear, please

[Outro: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Please, we're down to earth
A little better ground, a little better ground
Shake it up, shake it up, shake it up
Come on, let's make it better, let's make it better

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney, Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Better ground, more water
One sweet dream, two sweet dreams
Made for each girl, for each girl

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Better find your mother, deeper
Find where you belong
Find where you belong, hey Jude

If You’ve Got Trouble
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Got a lot of things to tell me
From what I've heard
If you've got trouble
Then you got less to talk about
What can I do?
Leave me alone
If you've got trouble
Then you got less to worry about

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney, Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Better come out to play
It doesn't really matter what clothes you wear
What you wear
Understand, it's nothing but love
Just love, relax
Just love, relax
Just love, relax
Just love, relax
Just love, intuitive
Just love, next to nothing
Exactly like you think it's easy
Just make it easy

[Interlude: Paul McCartney]
Get out of here
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Leave me alone
If you've got trouble
Then you've got less to worry about
What can I do?
Leave me alone

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney, Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, with you help
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees, yeah
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees, yeah

If You’ve Got Trouble
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Had a hard year
Got a bad breakup
That hurt me and made me blue
I lost someone like you
If you've got trouble
Then you got less to worry about
What can I do?
Leave me alone
If you've got trouble
Then you've less to worry about
What can I do?
Leave me alone

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Had a lot of things to tell me
Talking about you all the time
Talking about you all the time
Now you've changed your mind
You better find where you belong
<s_song>
If You've Got Trouble
[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Had a lot of things to tell me
Talking about you all the time
Talking about you all the time
Now you've changed your mind
You better find where you belong
<s_song>
Since You’re Gone
[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Had a lot of things to tell me
Talking about you all the time
Talking about you all the time
Now you've changed your mind
You better find where you belong
<s_song>
Since You've Got Trouble
[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Had a lot of things to tell me
Talking about you all the time
Talking about you all the time
Now you've changed your mind
You better find where you belong
