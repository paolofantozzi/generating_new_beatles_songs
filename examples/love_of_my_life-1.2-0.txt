Love of my life
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Is there a place I can go
When I feel low?
When I see you in your eyes
When I hear the things you want to say
And it sounds like years old
I'm going to get myself a drink
From an old fruit jar

[Chorus 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
All those years old, girl
You don't get much younger than me

[Verse 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Can you hear me, can you hear me
That I, I, I, I'm just a fool?
If you don't want to hear me, can't you hear me

[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Can you hear me, can you hear me
That I, I, I, I'm just a fool?
If you don't want to hear me, can't you hear me

[Verse 3: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
You know I got a way
You know I get rejected
You know I pick up girls like you do
You know I give you all I've got to give
To you, you know I need you

[Outro: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Love of my life
Hold me, love me
Hold me, love me
I ain't got no blues
Just a love like yours
Though I slip and fall
Like an old woman wont
When I get to the bottom
I'll turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn
Oh-oh

[Verse 4: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
You know I got a way
You know I get pretty rejected
You know I get sweetkered
You know I stick around
A little farther down the road
Like an old woman wont
When I get to the bottom
I'll turn, turn, turn, turn
Oh-oh

[Outro: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Love of my life
Hold me, love me
Hold me, love me
I ain't got no blues
Just a love like yours
Though I slip and fall
Like an old woman wont
When I get to the bottom
I'll turn, turn, turn, turn, turn
Oh-oh

[Verse 5: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
You know I get pretty sweet
Like an old woman wont
When I'm in love
Like an old woman won't
Take me home
Like an old woman wont
When I get home yeah
Oh-oh

[Verse 6: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
You know I talk about boys
Like an old woman wont
Get shy when they try to kiss
Like an old woman wont
Take me home
Like an old woman wont
When I'm home yeah
Oh-oh

[Verse 7: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
You know I pick up girls like you do
You know I get sweetkered
You know I pick up girls like you do
You know I give you all I've got to give
To you, you know I need you
