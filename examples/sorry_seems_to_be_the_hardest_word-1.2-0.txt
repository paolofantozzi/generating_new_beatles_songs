Sorry seems to be the hardest word
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
Please forgive me
I couldn't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
It's only love but the way you deceive me
I couldn't really live without you

[Verse 2]
Don't ask me why
I wouldn't want to hide away somehow
But you've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

[Chorus 1]
Can't really sleep, you know
I can't really stop my brain
You know I carry around a lot of weight
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

[Verse 3]
Please remember how I feel
I could never really live without you
So please, remember how I feel

[Chorus 2]
Can't really sleep, you know
I can't really stop my brain
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

Hey Jude
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]
Hey Jude,
 
don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
When you feel the pain
Well don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
When you feel the pain

Not Guilty
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1: Paul McCartney: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Woo)
Nothing bad could come of it, it's easy
Nothing bad could happen, it's easy
Oh, now, give me a wink and I'll dance to the song

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, Iowanda said goodbye to me, hey Jude
Hey Jude, don't let him go, leave me where he is
Leave me where he is, I'm sorry
Don't let him go, leave me where he is
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, she asked me to dance to her song
And I said yeah
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Woo)
Nothing bad could happen, it's easy
Oh, now, give me a wink and I'll dance to the song

[Bridge 1]
And in my hour of darkness, she was there with me
Standing there, with me
In her little blue eye
We held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Da, but I never lost my love

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, I'd really like to dance to her song
Because she told me
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Woo)
Nothing bad could come of it, it's easy
Oh, now, give me a wink and I'll dance to the song

[Verse 5: Paul McCartney: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, I'd really like to dance to her song
Because she told me
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Woo)
Nothing bad could come of it, it's easy
Oh, now, give me a wink and I'll dance to the song

[Chorus 1]
Can't really sleep, you know
I can't really stop my brain
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

[Chorus 2]
Can't really sleep, you know
I can't really stop my brain
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

[Interlude]
(Ah da, ah da, ah da)
Ah da, ah da, ah da
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
