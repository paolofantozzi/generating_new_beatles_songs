<s_song>
Stuck in the middle with you
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you

[Verse 2]
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
I cry for you

[Bridge]
Don't wanna make you old man cry
It's not right
Don't wanna make you old man cry

[Verse 3]
I'm wondering why you hurt me
I'm wondering why you hurt me so
I'm gonna cry for you

[Outro]
Don't wanna make me cry
You don't give a damn
I don't wanna make you old man cry
<e_song>

Please Mister Postman

[Verse 1]
Please Mister Postman
(Mister Postman, look and see)
Look and see
Is there a letter in your bag for me?
Please, please, Mister Postman
(I've been waiting a long, long time)
Oh yes, please, please, Mister Postman
(Since I heard from that girl of mine)

[Verse 2]
You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why you hurt me so
I'm gonna cry for you
