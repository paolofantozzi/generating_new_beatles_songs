Leave me alone
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

[Verse 2]
Don't want her, you don't need her
She's lonely as can be, so go away

[Bridge]
Don't need another love, don't need another kind
Love is all and love is everyone

[Verse 3]
She needs you, you need her, love is there for me
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

[Bridge]
Don't need another love, don't need another kind
Love is all and love is everyone

[Verse 4]
She needs you, you need her, love is there for me
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

[Bridge]
Don't need another love, don't need another kind
Love is all and love is everyone

Let It Be
[Lyrics]
[Intro]
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you

[Verse 1]
Let it be, let it be, let it be
Oh, let it be, let it be, let it be
Oh, let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Verse 2]
Listen to me, you don't know what I'm saying
I don't know what I'm saying
I don't know what I'm hoping you'll think
Maybe it's just me, maybe it's just me
Yeah, maybe it's just me, yeah
Oh, let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Verse 3]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Outro]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Oh, let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah
Whisper words of wisdom

Let It Be
[Verse 1]
When I want you into my heart I go out of my door
Every night since she's been gone
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I go and get her everywhere
Whenever she's beside me
I go and get her everywhere
Whenever she's near me
She's beside me, she's beside me
<s_song>
Let It Be
[Verse 1]
When I want you into my heart I go out of my door
Every night since she's been gone
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I go and get her everywhere
Whenever she's beside me
She's beside me, she's beside me
<s_song>
Let It Be
[Verse 2]
When I want you into my heart I go out of my door
Every night since she's been gone
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I go and get her everywhere
Whenever she's beside me
She's beside me, she's beside me
<s_song>
Let It Be
[Verse 3]
When I want you into my heart I go out of my door
Every night since she's been gone
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I go and get her everywhere
Whenever she's beside me
She's beside me, she's beside me
<s_song>Let It Be
[Verse 1]
When I want you into my heart I go out of my door
Every night since she's been gone
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I go and get her everywhere
Whenever she's beside me
She's beside me, she's beside me
<s_song>Let It Be
[Verse 1]
When I want you into my heart I go out of my door
Every night since she's been gone
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I go and get her everywhere
Whenever she's beside me
She's beside me, she's beside me
