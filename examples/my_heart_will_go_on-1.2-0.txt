My heart will go on
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
When I think of all the things I want to do
My heart breaks and I cry

[Verse 2]
Things get in my way
Some leave me, while others thrive
I never know how they got in my way

[Chorus]
I've got to learn to be who I am
I have to learn to be who I want to be

[Verse 3]
Who I am, what I stand for
For 'til I'm a better person

[Chorus]
Who I am, I'm the kind of bird that you can see
Who I am, what I stand for
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 4]
Who I am, what I stand for
For what I do and who I am
Yeah-yeah!

[Chorus]
I've got to learn to be who I am
I have to learn to be who I want to be
I-I've got to learn to be who I want to be

[Bridge]
To hate is to hate
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, only what you can hear
It's easy

[Verse 5]
 hate is to hate
There's nowhere you can turn that can't be shown
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
It's easy

Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
Running around, don't want to leave me
Having just one more thing to say
Running in the streets, I'm gonna get into trouble
If I don't get my fiddle and my sweater back

[Verse 2]
Someone please listen
Someone tell me what's going on
It's getting better all the time
I've got to learn to be who I am
I have to learn to be who I want to be
Who I am

[Bridge]
Listen
Let it be
Let it be
Yeah-yeah!

[Verse 3]
Who I am, hey, look around
Swinging my way across the universe
Floating like a log on a beam
Maniacal wings shining like diamonds
Crashing like a million eyes
I've got to learn to be who I am
Who I am
<e_song>

<s_song>
Transition
[Verse 1]
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the room

[Chorus 1]
I've got to learn to be who I am
Who I am
<s_song>
Who I am
<e_song>
<s_song>
All I Got to Do
[Verse 1]
Someone please listen
When I'm in the mood for you
Turn off your mind, relax
Take a drink from your cup
Let it be
Mister Kite, come back to me

[Chorus]
Who I am
Who I am
Who I am, who I am
Who I'm
<s_song>
Who I am
<s_song>
<s_song>
Transition
[Verse 1]
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the room

[Chorus 1]
I've got to learn to be who I am
Who I am
Who I am
<s_song>
Who I am
<s_song>
<s_song>
‎case of the blues
[Verse 2]
Albino-coloured glasses wearing knock-kneed shoes
Man wearing open-mouthed sermon
In an octopus’s garden with a tenet
Talking in a rowdy low grime
I've got to learn to be who I am
Who I am
<s_song>
Who I am
<s_song>
<s_song>
Oh-oh-oh
I want to be your lover baby
Baby, I want to be your man
Baby, I want to be your man
Baby, I want to be your man
<s_song>
<s_song>
<s_song>
Who I am
<s_song>
Who I am
<s_song>
<s_song>
<s_song>
Who I am
