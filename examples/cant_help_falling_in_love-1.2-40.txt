Can't Help Falling in Love
[Lyrics]
[Intro]
Can't help falling in love
I can't help it

[Verse 1]
I'm falling in love with you, it feels like years
I'm falling in love only to find there's no next time
<e_song>

<s_song>
Donâ€™t Pass Me By
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
I send you flowers, but you don't care
You never seem to see me standing there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long

[Verse 2]
I tell you that I'll romance again, but till I do, I'm always late
Falling in love with you, but every so often, I'm late
Still, I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long

[Bridge]
Far too long a lonely time
And I don't know what to do

[Verse 3]
You call me and I cry, but she doesn't care
You never seem to see me standing there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
<s_song>
Can't Help Falling in Love
[Verse 1]
I send you flowers, but you don't care
You never seem to see me standing there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long

[Bridge]
Far too long a lonely time
And I don't know what to do

[Verse 3]
You call me and I cry, but she doesn't care
You never seem to see me standing there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
<s_song>
Can't Help Falling in Love
 [Verse 1]
I don't want to leave you, I want to stay here
You never seem to see me standing there
I don't know what went wrong, I've waited far too long

[Verse 2]
I think of you and I cry, but she doesn't care
You never seem to see me standing there
I don't know what went wrong, I've waited far too long

[Bridge]
Far too long a lonely time
And I don't know what to do

[Verse 3]
You say I can't leave you, I don't want to stay here
You never seem to see me standing there
I don't know what went wrong, I've waited far too long

[Outro]
<s_song>
Can't Help Falling in Love
[Verse 1]
I don't want to leave you, I want to stay here
You never seem to see me standing there
I don't know what went wrong, I've waited far too long

[Outro]
<s_song>Can't Help Falling in Love
[Verse 1]
I don't want to leave you, I want to stay here
You never seem to see me standing there
I don't know what went wrong, I've waited far too long

[Verse 1]
I don't want to leave you, I want to stay here
You never seem to see me standing there
I don't know what went wrong, I've waited far too long

[Chorus]
Can't help falling in love
Can't help falling in love
Can't help falling in love

[Verse 2]
I don't want to leave you, I want to stay here
You never seem to see me standing there
I don't know what went wrong, I've waited far too long
<s_song>Can't Help Falling in Love
<s_song>
Can't Help Falling in Love
[Bridge]
Far too long a lonely time
And I don't know what to do

[Verse 3]
You whisper in my ear, "You don't need me, you don't need me"
You don't seem to realize I'm speaking, I'm speaking
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long

<s_song>Can't Help Falling in Love
[Chorus]Can't help falling in love
Can't help falling in love
Can't help falling in love
<s_song>Can't Help Falling in Love
[Outro]
<s_song>Can't Help Falling in Love
<s_song>Can't Help Falling in Love
<s_song>Can't Help Falling
