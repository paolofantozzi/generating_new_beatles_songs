Stuck in the middle with you
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
I'm a lonely man
You still don't know why
You still don't know how I feel

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in your love for me
I don't know how you've been hiding
You still don't know why

[Bridge]
I've known the secret of my love
I don't know how you got so much as a whisper

[Verse 3]
Your love has made me weak
So it's asking me to be soft

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
I've known the secret of my love for you
I don't know how you've been hiding
You still don't know how I feel

[Verse 4]
Somewhere in your love for me
I don't know how you've been hiding
You still don't know how I feel

[Bridge]
I've known the secret of my love for you
I don't know how you've been hiding

Mean Mr. Mustard
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in an English garden, trying to save paper

[Verse 2]
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the dark trying to save paper
Waits at the window, reading the news
Noisy calls calling, asking for tea
Calls from across the room
Meaning Mister Mustard sleeps in the dark
Waits at the window, waiting at the paper trail

[Bridge]
I've known the secret of my love (I don't know how you've been hiding)
I don't know how you've been hiding

I Got A Woman
[Verse 1]
She lends me a hand (Please)
When she's lonely
Gets near me and I feel low
She says she loves me just like I need you
Kindly sending me love invitations
When I'm lonely as can be (Go to rock and roll)

[Verse 2]
She lends me a hand (Please)
When she's lonely
Gets near me and I feel low
She says she loves me just like I need you
Kindly sending me love invitations
When I'm lonely as can be (Go to rock and roll)

[Bridge]
I've known the secret of my love (I don't know how you've been hiding)
I don't know how you've been hiding
I don't know how you've been hiding
