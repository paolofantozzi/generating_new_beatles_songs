Love of my life
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone

[Verse 2]
There is a place
Where I can spend my days
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone

[Bridge]
When I'm alone, it's all right
I'm here to love you
And it's true
I love you more than ever

[Verse 3]
I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
But I know that you will leave me
If I'm true, I won't stay here
But I've found a way
I won't leave you

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 1]
There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone

[Bridge]
When I'm alone, it's all right
I'm here to love you
And it's true
I love you more than ever

[Verse 2]
I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
But I know that you will leave me
If I'm true, I won't stay here
But I've found a way
I won't leave you

[Bridge]
When I'm alone, it's all right
I'm here to love you
And it's true
I love you more than ever

How Do You Do It?
[Lyrics]
[Intro]
One, two, three, four
Can you dance?
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, I love you

[Verse 1]
Someone tells me that you make me feel fine
I think they're right
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine
Can you dance?
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, I love you

[Bridge]
I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
But I know that you will leave me
If I'm true, I won't leave you
<e_song>
How Do You Do It?
[Verse 1]
You make me feel alright
When you're by my side
Treat me like you did the night before
Don't want to stay here
But I know that you will leave me
If I'm true, I won't leave you
<s_song>
How Do You Do It?
[Verse 1]
The dance is on
It's on
I want to dance
When I feel low
When I feel blue
When I feel blue
How do you do it?
