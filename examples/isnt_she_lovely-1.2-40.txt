Isn't she lovely
[Lyrics]
[Intro]
Till we're past the point where she's gone
And I just can't go on

[Verse 1]
I'll pretend that I'm kissing her lips
And hoping they'll close
When I do, I'll say she's my bride
And we'll never be apart

[Chorus]
Isn't she sweet?
Isn't she lovely?

[Verse 2]
We'll be apart when she's gone, I won't be there when she's gone
He'll text me and I'll send home, he wrote me only one sad night
And though I'll get through, I still love her

[Bridge]
Isn't she sweet?
Isn't she lovely?

[Verse 3]
So we'll be apart when she's gone, won't we be there when she's gone?

[Interlude]
Till there's a place for us
Where we can call each other on and off
And forget all about the past

[Chorus]
Isn't she sweet?
Isn't she lovely?

[Bridge]
Isn't she sweet?
Isn't she lovely?

[Verse 4]
Let me be her kiss her lips
Let me be her kiss her lips
Till we're past the point where she's gone
And I just can't go on

[Chorus]
Isn't she sweet?
Isn't she lovely?

[Interlude]
Till there's a place for us
Where we can call each other on and off
And forget all about the past

Oh! Darling
[Lyrics]
[Intro]
(Oh!)

[Verse 1]
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby!
Why do you treat me so unkind?
Why leave me crying here?
Let me know the way!

[Verse 2]
You've really got a hold on me, now
You've really got a hold on me, now
Oh, now, twist and shout
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Why do you treat me so unkind?
Why leave me crying here?
Let me know the way!

[Verse 3]
You've really got a hold on me, now
You've really got a hold on me, now
Oh, now, twist and shout
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Why do you treat me so unkind?
Why leave me crying here?
Let me know the way!

[Verse 4]
You've really got a hold on me, now
You've really got a hold on me, now
Oh, now, twist and shout
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Why do you treat me so unkind?
Why leave me crying here?
Let me know the way
