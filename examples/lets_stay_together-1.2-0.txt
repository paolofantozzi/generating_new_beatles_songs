Let's stay together
[Lyrics]
[Intro]
If you leave me
Don't let me alone
Don't tell me how you feel

[Verse 1]
You won't believe me
When you know I care
How much you really love me and how
It's only a matter of time
Will we forget you?

[Chorus 1]
Please, don't spoil my day
Everything's got to be just like you imagined
Because I know we all love you

[Verse 2]
We said our goodbye
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've got so many things I've gotta do
To make you know we'll be together this time

[Chorus 2]
Please, don't spoil my day
Everything's got to be just like you imagined
Because I know we all love you
You know we all love you

Keep a Day The Way You See Me Do
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
Let me stay together
If you leave me
Don't let me alone
Don't tell me how you feel
But I know we all love you
You know we all love you
<s_song>
Let's stay together
[Verse 2]
Let me stay with you
Whenever you want me at all
Just call on me and I'll send it along
Yeah, I've got some things I've gotta say to you
When you're lonely, lonely, yeah
Oh, I've got something to say to you
<s_song>
Let It Be
[Verse 1]
When I get near you
The days are few, they're filled with tears
I've got every reason to be sad
When I get near you
Keep a day the way you see me do
The way you do when you don't want me at all
Just call on me and I'll send it along
<s_song>
Let It Be
[Verse 1]
When I get near you
The days are few, they're filled with tears

Keep a day the way you do when you don't want me there
Just call on me and I'll send it along
Yeah, I've got some things I've gotta say to you
When you're lonely, lonely, yeah
Oh, I've got some things I've gotta say to you
When you're lonely, lonely, yeah
<s_song>
Let It Be

When you're lonely, lonely, yeah
<s_song>It Be (Whisper)
[Verse 2]
Once in a while, you forget everything
You forget her, she seems to forget
Sometimes I wonder should I call on her
But I don't know how I'm to get her off my mind
Cause I know too much already, I've got something to say
I've got a thing or two to say
That's all I've got to do
<s_song>
Let It Be
[Verse 1]
When I get near you
The days are few, they're filled with tears
I've got every reason to be sad
When I get near you
Keep a day the way you do when you don't want me there
Just call on me and I'll send it along

Just call on me and I'll send it along
Yeah, I've got some things I've gotta say to you
When you're lonely, lonely, yeah
Yeah, I've got some things I've gotta say to you
<s_song>
Let It Be
[Verse 1]
When I get near you
The days are few, they're filled with tears
I've got every reason to be mad
When I get near you
Keep a day the way you do when you don't want me there
Just call on me and I'll send
