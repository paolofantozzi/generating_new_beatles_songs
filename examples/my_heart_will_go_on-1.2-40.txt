My heart will go on
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
When I see you go by (even when I'm alone)
I say, "Keep your head, don't you step on my blue shoes"
When you're passing on your way (I'm really feeling blue)
I say, "Keep your distance, I'm really feeling down"

[Verse 2]
I send my girl (girl) flowers on a whim (My heart goes on)
But the way you hurt me, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
I said, "I gotta go (To love you, I'm gonna go)"

[Bridge]
You know I hate to see you go (It's getting better, I'm getting better)
But I'll get you, I'll get you, I'll get you in the end (I'll get you in the end)
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, whoa oh, oh

[Verse 3]
I cry over you, over you, yeah (I cry over you)
I cry over you, over you, yeah (I cry over you)
I cry over you, over you, oh yeah

[Verse 4]
I'm so sad and lonely (I don't want to die)
I've got so many lonely people (I don't want to die)
So I will cry over you, oh yeah (I cry over you)

[Bridge]
You know I hate to see you go (It's getting better, I'm getting better)
But I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, whoa oh, oh

[Verse 5]
Well I'll get you in the end (I'm really feeling down)
I say, "At the end, oh yeah, oh yeah"
Whoa oh, oh, oh yeah (I'm really feeling down)

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 6]
I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah
I say, "At the end, oh yeah, oh yeah"
Whoa oh, oh, oh yeah
I say, "At the end, oh yeah, oh yeah"

Not guilty
Not guilty
I'm not nodding for the rest of my life

You're not trying to steal my love
I'm not trying to steal your heart (Oh yeah)
You're not trying to steal my heart (Oh yeah)
I'm not trying to steal your heart (Oh yeah)
You're not trying to steal my heart (Oh yeah)
I'm not trying to steal your heart (Oh yeah)
