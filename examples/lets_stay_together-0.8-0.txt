Let's stay together
[Lyrics]
[Intro]
One, two, three, four
Can I have a little more?
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, I love you

[Verse 1]
I'll let you know when we're through
Until then I'll cry instead

[Verse 2]
I'll make you maybe next time around
If I find the time
I can get you into my life

[Bridge]
I want you, I want you so bad
I want you, I want you so bad, it's driving me mad
It's driving me mad
I want you, you know I want you so bad
You don't want no one, you know I want you so bad

[Verse 3]
I want you, you know I want you so bad
I want you, you know I want you so bad, babe
I want you, you know I want you so bad, babe
You don't want no one, you know I want you so bad
You don't want no one, you know I want you so bad, babe

If you let me stay, I'll stay with you
If I don't, I won't stay with you
If I don't, you'll stay with me

It's just a thought, it's just a thought
It's just a thought, it's just a thought
It's just a thought, it's just a thought
