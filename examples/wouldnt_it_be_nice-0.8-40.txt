Wouldn't it be nice
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Though some days you feel like you've lost your mind
There are places we'll all be
If not tonight
For friends and lovers we'll all be gone

[Verse 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Though some days you feel like you've lost your mind
There are places we'll all be
If not tonight
For lovers and lovers we'll all be gone

[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Though some days you feel like you've lost your mind
There are places we'll all be
If not tonight
For lovers and lovers we'll all be gone

[Verse 3: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Though some days you feel like you've lost your mind
There are places we'll all be
If not tonight
For lovers and lovers we'll all be gone
