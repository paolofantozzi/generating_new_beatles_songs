Stuck in the middle with you
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
I was meeting new people every day
It wasn't easy, it was true
But I knew how much I could lose if I let you down

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
You didn't win, you didn't lose anyhow
You knew I wanted you to be mine
And so, I just can't go on

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And I know that losing someone so dear will mean so much
But I know that losing someone like you will mean so much

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
You didn't win, you didn't lose anyhow
You knew I wanted you to be mine
And so, I just can't go on

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Oh, you were right I was nervous
Because I knew you would leave me waiting, but I could see you've gone
And so, I just can't go on

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
I couldn't really sit down, I could feel my face hurting
And it's true, I knew that losing someone like you would mean so much
It's so hard loving you, it's so hard loving you
You know I want you to be mine, and so I just can't go on

[Guitar Solo: John Lennon]
You didn't win, you didn't lose a single thing
You knew I wanted you to be mine
And so, I just can't go on

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Oh, you were right I was nervous
Because I knew you would leave me waiting, but I could see you've gone
And so, I just can't go on

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
I thought you were fine
But in the end, you were wrong
Because I knew you would leave me waiting
And so, I just can't go on

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Oh, I couldn't really sit down, I could feel my face hurting
And it's true, I knew you would go
And so, I just can't go on

‎case of the blues
[Lyrics]
[Intro: John Lennon & Paul McCartney, 
Paul McCartney
]
Albino-coloured glasses wearing knock-kneed shoes
Seventh church is on his head its on-headed glue
Sales in the morning, it's a case of the blues oh oh oh

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Last night the judge gave the order
No one came
Yesterday's child gave the warning
No one was saved
It was a case of the blues oh oh oh

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Anna (Anna)
Just found out  Anna’s birthday was yesterday
Just a knock-kneed shoe
Anna found out yesterday's birthday was yesterday
Just a knock-kneed shoe
Anna, 
13, was found dead in the church and the mother didn't want to go
The baby said, "I don't want to be with you"

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Oh, you were right I was nervous
Because I knew you would leave me waiting
And so, I just can't go on
I'm sorry, I was wrong, I was wrong
You didn't win, you didn't lose a single thing
You knew I wanted you to be mine
You know I want you to be mine, and so I just can't go on

[Guitar Solo: John Lennon]
You didn't win, you didn't lose a single thing
You knew I wanted you to be mine
You know I want you to be mine, and so I just can't go on
You know I want you to be mine
