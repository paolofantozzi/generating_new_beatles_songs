I don't want to miss a thing
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
I don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me to do (other than watch)
If she turns up while I'm gone, please let me know

[Verse 2]
I've got no time for trivialities
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me to do (other than watch)
If she turns up while I'm gone, please let me know

[Bridge]
Don't wanna spoil the party, so I'll go
I do all my tears for you and me, hey!

[Verse 3]
Whoa, oh, my baby's gone, hey hey
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 5]
Well, she said she's travelling between places
So, she said she's travelling between places
