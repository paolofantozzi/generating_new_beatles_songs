Sorry seems to be the hardest word
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes, I know I've been a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now

[Verse 2]
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes, I know I've been a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now

[Bridge]
Now it's past my bed I know I'll cry
And in my heart, she says
I've got to admit it's true
Yes, she says now
I've got to admit it's true

[Verse 3]
She tells me what she wants to say
And in my heart, she says
I've got to admit it's true

[Bridge]
Now it's past my bed I know I'll cry
And in my heart, she says
I've got to admit it's true
