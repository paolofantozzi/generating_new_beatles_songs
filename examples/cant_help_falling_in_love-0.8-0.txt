Can't Help Falling in Love
[Lyrics]
[Intro]
Can't help falling in love
I can't help it

[Verse 1]
I'm falling in love with you
I can't help it
But I'm always wondering why
It's so hard for a girl like you to hold me
Can't help falling in love

[Chorus]
I'm falling in love for you (I'm falling in love)
I'm falling in love for you (I'm falling in love)
You're falling in love for me (Oh my darling)

[Verse 2]
I'm falling in love with you
Why, do you think I need you?
I can't help it
But I'm always wondering why
It's so hard for a girl like you to hold me
Can't help falling in love

[Bridge]
I'm falling in love for you (I'm falling in love)
You're falling in love for me (Oh my darling)
You're falling in love for me (Oh my darling)
