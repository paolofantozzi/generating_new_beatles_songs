Let's stay together
[Lyrics]
[Chorus]
You're leaving home tonight
And I'm feeling blue and lonely
Just like I've never been born

[Verse 1]
If you want me home (
I'll be coming home to you
)
You can come here anytime
anywhere
no one can tell me why

[Chorus]
You're leaving home tonight
And I'm feeling blue and lonely
Just like I've never been born

[Verse 2]
If you want me home
(
I'll be coming here
)
You can come here anytime
anywhere
no one can tell me why

[Chorus]
You're leaving home tonight
And I'm feeling blue and lonely
Just like I've never been born

[Verse 3]
If you want me home
(
I'll be coming here
)
You can come here anytime
anywhere
no one can tell me why

[Chorus]
You're leaving home tonight
And I'm feeling blue and lonely
Just like I've never been born

[Verse 4]
If you want me home
(
I'll be coming here
)
You can come here anytime
anywhere
no one can tell me why

[Chorus]
You're leaving home tonight
And I'm feeling blue and lonely
Just like I've never been born

I don't care if I'm lonely anymore
I don't care if I'm lonely anymore
