Leave me alone
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
The things she does
Leave me alone
Don't know the ways she loves me
I don't know how she knows

[Chorus]
You don't belong there
You don't belong there
Don't know how she feels about you

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

[Chorus]
You don't belong there
You don't belong there
Don't know how she feels about you

[Verse 3]
You don't belong there
You don't belong there
Don't know how she feels about you

[Outro]
You don't belong there
You don't belong there

Leave Me Alone
[Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
Although I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day the wind will blow, the sun will shine
But somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
<s_song>
Leave Me Alone
[Verse 2]
While I try to make her mine
One day the wind will blow, the sun will shine
But somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
<s_song>
Leave Me Alone
[Verse 3]
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day the wind will blow, the sun will shine
But somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

<s_song>
Leave Me Alone
[Verse 1]
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day the wind will blow, the sun will shine
But somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
<s_song>
Leave Me Alone
[Verse 2]
While I try to make her mine
One day the wind will blow, the sun will shine
But somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

<s_song>Leave Me Alone

Come Together

Tomorrow Never Knows
[Verse 1]
Nobody ever really mattered
Nothing really stands in my way
Nothing really compares to you anyhow
Nothing really buys me love
Nothing really shows me
Nothing really shows me

[Verse 2]
Nobody really knew what a kiss could be
Nothing really compares to you anyhow
Nothing really compares to you anyhow
Nothing really shows me

[Outro]
Nothing really stands in my way
Nothing really compares to you anyhow
Nothing really shows me
<s_song>
Tomorrow Never Knows
[Verse 1]
Nobody really knew what a kiss could be
Nobody really knew what a kiss could be
Nothing really compares to you anyhow
Nothing really compares to you anyhow
<s_song>
Tomorrow Never Knows
[Verse 2]
Nobody really knew what a kiss could be
Nobody really knew what a kiss could be
Nothing really compares to you anyhow
Nothing really compares to you anyhow

<s_song>
Tomorrow Never Knows
[Outro]
Nobody really knew what a kiss could be
Nobody really knew what a kiss could be
Nothing really compares to you anyhow
<s_song>
Tomorrow Never Knows
[Verse 1]
Nobody really knew what a kiss could be
Nobody really knew what a kiss could be
Nobody really knew what a kiss could be
Nothing really compares to you anyhow
Nothing really compares to you anyhow
<s_song>
Tomorrow Never Knows
[Verse 2]
Nobody really knew what a kiss could be
Nobody really knew what a kiss could be
Nobody really knew what a kiss could be
Nothing really compares to you anyhow
