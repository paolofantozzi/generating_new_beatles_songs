Let's stay together
[Lyrics]
[Intro: Paul McCartney]
1, 2, 3, 4!

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]
Two of us sending postcards, writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
, 
lifting latches
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]
Two of us standing alone, writing letters
On my wall
You and I burning matches
, 
lifting latches
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
You and I burning matches, 
lifting latches
On our way back home

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]
Two of us sending postcards, writing letters
On my wall
You and I burning matches
, 
lifting latches
On our way home

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
You and I have memories that go back years
(We used to be apart)
And it keeps me warm in the sun
(Are you going to forget me?
Yes)

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]
Two of us sleeping, writing letters
On my wall
You and I burning matches
, 
lifting latches
On our way home

[Verse 5: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Verse 6: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]
Two of us sleeping, writing letters
On my wall
You and I burning matches
, 
lifting latches
On our way home

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
You and I have memories that go back years
(We used to be apart)
And it keeps me warm in the sun
(Are you going to forget me?
Yes)

[Verse 7: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]
Two of us sleeping, writing letters
On my wall
You and I burning matches
, 
lifting latches
On our way home

[Verse 8: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Outro: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Two of us sleeping, writing letters
On my wall
You and I burning matches
, 
lifting latches
On our way home
